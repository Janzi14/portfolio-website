# Portfolio Website
## Objective
I created this little Website to start adding fun projects to my Github-Profile.

With this specific project I wanted to refresh my Webdesign Skills. In the next days, there are more projects to come...
## Structure
This Website just uses plain css and html.
## Idea
I got the idea from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and modified it.
