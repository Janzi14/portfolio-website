                <h3>Why programming?</h3>
                <p>Growing up, I had many ideas, what I wanted to do. For example, I wanted to become a professional
                    football player or once I even a pilot.</p>
                <h4>Time to decide </h4>
                <p>As with everybody there comes a time, when you have to decide, what to do.
                    Amoung the last professions where physical therapist, philosopher and Computer Programmer.
                    My fate was decided for me, after injuring my knee so badly, that even now (two years later), apart
                    from taking a walk and going very light on the ergometer I can't really do much physical activities.
                    Of course, mentally especially the first few months were very challenging.
                    After accepting the whole situation, I saw this as a chance to sharpen my mind. After all, I was
                    accustomed to training my body and trying to learn new movements constantly.
                    So why shouldn't I do for my brain, what I had done for my body all my life?!
                    That was the start of my journey as a programmer and a restart in sharpening my skills.</p>
                <h4>A good decision?</h4>
                <p>As of now, I currently studying "Business Software Development" at a university, called <a
                        target="_blank" href="https://www.campus02.at/wirtschaftsinformatik/bachelor/bsd/">FH
                        Campus02</a>, because I thought, learning autodidatictically is great, but having a curriculum
                    and a network of professormand students in addition to learning at your own, makes the process much
                    more gratifying, in my opinion.
                    Let's see, what the future holds for me, but right now, I'm very happy the decision of studying
                    here.
